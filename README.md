# Treon
This is our repository for thesis.

Please take note of the following:

The files will be zipped, and each folder corresponds version number.

We will use semantic versioning:

--- MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH ---

MAJOR – Big changes; backward-incompatible (e.g., new architecture).

MINOR – New features; backward-compatible.

PATCH – Bug fixes or small tweaks; backward-compatible.



We will start with: TreonUser1.0.0 & TreonAdmin1.0.0

To download: Click the ZIP file, and click "View Raw" then the download will automatically start


Inform me the changes first before uploading into the repository so we could double check the version number.


SALAMAT !! :)
